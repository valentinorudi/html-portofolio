<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hi, I'm Kai Valentino. I'm a passionate learner and freelancer who specializes
  in creating engaging landing pages using Figma. I enjoy combining creativity
  and functionality to build designs that resonate with users.
</p>
<p>
  When I'm not designing, I spend my time learning new web development skills,
  connecting with professionals, and offering laptop services through my small
  business, kliniklaptoprudi.
</p>
<p>
  Feel free to reach out to me if you need help with landing page design, laptop
  upgrades, or finding reliable second-hand laptops!
